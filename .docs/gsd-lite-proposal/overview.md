# GSD-Lite: Optimization for Local & Non-Claude LLMs - Overview

## Goal

The current GSD framework relies on complex multi-agent orchestration and heavy context loading (7+ context files, parallel agents), which causes failures in Local LLMs and non-Claude models. The goal is to introduce a "Lite" mode that simplifies context generation, merges workflow steps, and provides robust task management suitable for models with lower reasoning/context capabilities.

## Research Findings & Pain Points

1.  **Codebase Mapping Complexity**:
    - **Current**: `map-codebase` spawns 4 parallel agents reading ~700 lines of prompt each, generating 7 markdown files (`STACK.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, etc.).
    - **Issue**: Local LLMs fail to follow the complex formatting instructions or hallucinate content. Orchestration overhead is too high.
    - **Solution**: Replace agent-based mapping with **deterministic script-based mapping** (`tree`, `grep`, `stats`).

2.  **Context Overload**:
    - **Current**: `plan-phase` loads all 7 mapping docs + `PROJECT.md` + `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
    - **Issue**: Consumes too much context window; confuses smaller models with irrelevant details.
    - **Solution**: Consolidate into a single `CONTEXT_LITE.md` generated by the script.

3.  **Workflow Granularity**:
    - **Current**: `Discuss` -> `Plan` -> `Execute` -> `Verify` (many hops).
    - **Issue**: Local LLMs lose the "thread" or state between many transitions.
    - **Solution**: Unified **"Task Loop"**: `Define` -> `Do` (Plan+Execute+Verify in one or two tightly coupled steps).

4.  **Task Management**:
    - **Current**: Manual edits to `task.md`.
    - **Issue**: Models often break markdown formatting or lose track of nested items.
    - **Solution**: A CLI-assisted task manager (e.g., `scripts/task_manager.sh`) or a strict, simplified `TODO.md` format.
