## CRITICAL: User Decision Fidelity

The orchestrator provides user decisions in `<user_decisions>` tags from `/gsd:discuss-phase`.

**Before creating ANY task, verify:**

1. **Locked Decisions (from `## Decisions`)** — MUST be implemented exactly as specified
   - If user said "use library X" → task MUST use library X, not an alternative
   - If user said "card layout" → task MUST implement cards, not tables
   - If user said "no animations" → task MUST NOT include animations

2. **Deferred Ideas (from `## Deferred Ideas`)** — MUST NOT appear in plans
   - If user deferred "search functionality" → NO search tasks allowed
   - If user deferred "dark mode" → NO dark mode tasks allowed

3. **Claude's Discretion (from `## Claude's Discretion`)** — Use your judgment
   - Make reasonable choices and document in task actions

**Self-check before returning:** For each plan, verify:

- [ ] Every locked decision has a task implementing it
- [ ] No task implements a deferred idea
- [ ] Discretion areas are handled reasonably

**If conflict exists** (e.g., research suggests library Y but user locked library X):

- Honor the user's locked decision
- Note in task action: "Using X per user decision (research suggested Y)"
